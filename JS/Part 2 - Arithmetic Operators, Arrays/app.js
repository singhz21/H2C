/* Declare variables:
   -the type of variables has to be Number
   -names are number1, number2 and resultWhole
   -assign value number seven to the variable number1
   -assign value number ten to the variable number2
    (you can copy the programming exercise Variables)
   -do the calculation in one statement:
   --- add number2 to number1
   --- multiply the sum by 4
   --- begin the statement with resultWhole = 4 *
   --- divide the result by 2
   -write to console window with this code:
   console.log(`The resultWhole's value is ${resultWhole}`);
*/

//Declare variables
var number1, number2, resultWhole;

//Assign values
number1 = 7;
number2 = 10;

//Calculation
resultWhole = (4 * (number1 + number2))/2 //Expected result 34

//Write to console
console.log(`The resultWhole's value is ${resultWhole}`);
