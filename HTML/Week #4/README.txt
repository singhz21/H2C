Pls. view the lecture here. The float and positioning properties were introduced and discussed, they are your essential tools for layout on webpages.

Your Small Task #3
You need to create a simple webpage with following specs using the positioning (position) properties

500px by 500 px. The content is centered on the page and it has the structure as follows (see image)
the nav and the footer are each 100px high. In the picture below the nav uses hexa color #cff and the footer color #fcc.
the content in each section is positioned as follows: from the top 10px and from both left and right 25px using the top, left, bottom, right properties as needed.
the section is colored using hexa color #ffc
The use of a container is strongly recommended. The container is in practice a simple div tag with certain properties. It contains the nav, section, and footer elements.

Your webpage should look like this: See "The webpage as it should look.png
