Small Task #1, 10p - week 36, 2-8.9.2019
The first lecture 31.8.2019
During this lecture, a small website consisting of a homepage and 3 subpages was created. Your task is to:

On the homepage, the one named index.html, insert a second header under the existing <h1> heading. This second header needs to be marked up using the <h4> tag. The second heading also needs to be split into two lines and formatted using italics (use the <i> tag for this)
Change the image to one of your own choosing and remember to update the alt attribute correspondingly.
On page one, pageone.html, replace the image with a 2 by 2 table (2 rows and two columns). See the <table> tag and corresponding <tr> and <td> tags for this.
In the table on row 1 column 1 insert a 100 by 100 pixel sized image. Use the <img> tag attributes width and/or height for this.
On row 1 column 2 of the same table you need to insert some left aligned text split up on two lines using the <br> tag.
On row 2 column 1 you need to insert some right aligned text also split up on two lines.
On row 2 column 2 you insert an 100 by 100 pixel image.
That's all folks - good luck and pls upload your code (index.html and pageone.html) by end of Thursday, Sept 6..!
