The second lecture 7.9.2019
We focused on the <form> element and its use. This is the basic tool you use to provide input to your webpage. Pls view the lecture here.

Your Small Task #2
You need to create a simple Sign Up form using following input controls:

type Text
type Password
type Checkbox, include at least three boxes and use following choices (labels): Sports, Entertainment, Dining. Use Interests as a heading for the boxes
type Radio button for choices headed Gender. Choices provided are headed: Male, Female, Other
An free text input headed Additional information. Use the <textarea> element with 3 rows and 50 columns (or a width you prefer).
type Submit button labeled Sign Me Up!
You need to drop your input controls into a table in order to vertically align the labels and controls. Use white space (blank rows) to further enhance your form. Try to horizontally center the submit button using the colspan and align attributes.

That's it folks, the task needs to be uploaded by Friday 13th. A solution will be provided during the lecture on Saturday. Good luck..!
