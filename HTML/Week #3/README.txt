Major Assignment #1, 20p - week 38, 16-22.9.2019
The third lecture with a suggested solution to small task #2 
Pls view the lecture here ( https://vamk.zoom.us/recording/play/rP4iHSkIw6x4JJTvg9I2uA8U7yfk1p-gwc4wCNFSXgZrdd422Jf6yCDvVK-cy18j?continueMode=true ). It starts with a suggested partial solution and continues with the basics of CSS.

The Major Task #1
Create a website with a homepage linking to a picture gallery and a sign up page. Use the pages we've already created as a basis.

The picture gallery page consists of a table element with probably two columns and between two and ten rows, you decide. Fill that table with images and corresponding text arranged in a similar fashion as in the small tasks and lecture.

The sign up form consists of the same input controls as we've already used (and also the text area element). Also, whenever the submit button is clicked, and the data is forwarded, you need to open up a new Thank You page (name it thankyou.html and save it in the folder along with the rest of your material) where you thank people for signing up to your service. On this page a return link to the sign up page and a link to the home page is required.

From both the gallery page and the sign up page you provide a link back to the home page. 

Use basic CSS rules of your choice to form the h1, p and table (including tr and td) elements. 

That's it for this time, the assignment needs to be uploaded by Friday 20th. A suggested solution will be provided during the lecture on Saturday. Good luck..!
